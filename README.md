# R and Tensorflow!

## Why Use R with Tensorflow?

## Repo Contents

If you're completely new to using R with Tensorflow, the hello_keras.Rmd notebook will give you an introduction.

Reproducibility.Rmd shows how to share and reuse models.

Visualize.Rmd is a playground for leveraging R's data visualization methods for introspecting experiment results.


**Examples** - You can find 2 examples in the [R](https://github.com/IBM/using-tensorflow-with-r/tree/master/R) folder:

- [mnist_mlp](https://github.com/IBM/using-tensorflow-with-r/tree/master/R/mnist_mlp): Trains a simple deep NN on the MNIST dataset.

- [cats_and_dogs_small](https://github.com/IBM/using-tensorflow-with-r/tree/master/R/cats_and_dogs_small/scripts): Convnet for dogs-versus-cats classification. 


## How to Use

Download large datasets to the downloads/ folder and git will ignore them.

Models are written to the models/ folder.
